### Hi There! I'm Rudy

I'm a 17 year old maker from Toronto who loves hardware.

Some cool stuff that I've done are:
- Organized a Hackathon @ Shopify Toronto for teenagers!
- Got one of my project featured on a magazine cover
- Participated in Canada's largest hackathon, Hack The North!
- Ran my own programs online in Hack Club
- Designed a sick cover for my school's annual yearbook

I'm current working on:
- [Allwinner V3s Based SBC](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/V3S-SBC)
- [Audio Development Board](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/Audio-Devboard)
